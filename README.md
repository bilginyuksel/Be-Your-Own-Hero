# Be Your Own Hero

First of all, this application is built for people who need motivation and encouragement. People have to believe in themselves, because if people believe in themselves, they can do anything they want. In our world, we need confident, succesfull people to work and to communicate with. So to solve this problem, I created this application.

# How does it work ? 
This program uses Firebase Realtime database servers and sqLite local database. In the Firebase server, we store user information, user authentication, words and notification services. Local database stores your favourite words and your timeline. We have two receivers: alarm receiver (for reminder and alarm) and notification receiver. The application can send instant notifications or scheduled notifications (for example you can choose to schedule the notification everyday at 11 am or just on a specific day of the week) from Firebase. If you are interested, you can examine the code.

 # 4. Main Screen
 On the main screen, you have a timeline. In that timeline, you can see your scheduled things, like reminder or alarm. If you set an alarm or a reminder, you can see them in the timeline and you can edit them as you like. And I know you are curious about the unicorn. Click _Unicorn_ to see your profile information. But don't forget, this application is not like any other application. Your profile information is a story written for you! And the most important thing and our main goal ix the _Fist_ which serves to send you occasional motivational words. When you click _Fist_, you can see the motivation words which are given accordingly to your interests. And if you like them, you can keep them to read some other time with the _Star_. <br><br>
