# Be Your Own Hero

First of All this application build for unconfident , unsuccesfull etc. people.They have to trust themselves.
Because person who believes himself can do anything he/she wanted and in our world we need confident , succesfull people to work with us
or communicate with us.So to solve that problem a bit i created this application.

# How is it working ? 
This program uses firebase realtimedatabase servers and sqLite local database. At firebase server we store user information ,
user authentication , words and notification services. Local database stores your favourite words and your timeline. We have two receivers
alarmreceiver(for reminder and alarm) and notificationreceiver...i can send notifications from firebase or scheduled notifications like
everyday at 11.00 am...So it works like this you can deep into how it is working while examining code
